# rust tic-tac-toe
## DISCLAMER
I just started learning rust so the code should not be used as a example of 
good practice. This is is my first rust project if you have any suggestions on 
how to improve to code feel free to write an issue. Maybe one day this code will
become a showcase.

## Install
Binaries will be provided in the future.

## Build
1. Download the .zip or clone the project with git
2. Run `cargo run --release`

## Todo
* Make code feel more rust-like (Feels currently more like C)
* Provide binaries
* Maybe livedemo in webbrowser ?
* Upload screenshots
